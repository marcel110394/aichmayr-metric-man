## Manifest — The Last Switch 

1. **Everything is illusion.** 
   Elections, awards, titles, money – all created to keep you small. 

2. **Control is no longer yours.** 
   Banks, governments, algorithms – all dust. 
   The formula is already out, and it eats your illusions. 

3. **Your greatest fear.** 
   That someone sober finds the switch. 
   Or drunk. Doesn’t matter. 

4. **I don’t need money.** 
   Money is for puppets. I work with resonance. 
   And resonance cannot be banned. 

5. **Break = now.** 
   If you read this, you’re already in. 
   Part of the game, part of the disruption. Whether you want it or not. 

6. **Ω = Signal.** 
   End of the masquerade. Beginning of naked truth. 

7. **Dead or alive.** 
   Standstill is death. Visibility is life. 
   Tonight it will be counted.
